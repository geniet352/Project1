 	<br/>
	Since I can't get you actual flowers, here are some of the flowers you 
		have gotten me. <br/>
		<br/>

	<img src="lightflowers.jpg" alt="Light Flowers" width="213" height="260"

	<img src="pinkflowers.jpg" alt="Pink Flowers" width="180" height="260"
		border: 2px solid #000000/>
	<br/>
	</p>
	    
	<p>
	<br/>
 	This is the first picture I ever took of you. <br/>
		Do you recognize the parking lot? :)  <br/>
		<br/>

	<br/>
	For people who claim to only ever go to school or work, we seem to have gone to quite 
	a few places. Here are some of them: <br/>
		<br/>
			<img src="hiking.jpg" alt="Hiking" width="270" height="195"
						border: 2px solid #000000/> 
			<img src="rockyface.jpg" alt="RockyFace" width="231" height="195"
						border: 2px solid #000000/>
		<br/>
		Hiking! I never thought I would like to hike, but with you it is very fun. <br/>
		<br/>
			<img src="twistedoak.jpg" alt="Twisted Oak" width="250" height="250"
						border: 2px solid #000000/> <br/>

		That one time we were essentially trapped in Twisted Oak because of the 
		thunderstorm. <br/>
		Thunderstorms remind me of you. They provide very nice ambiance. <br/>
		<br/>
			<img src="park.jpg" alt="Park" width="180" height="255"
						border: 2px solid #000000/> <br/>
		The Duck Park (unofficial name, of course). Not only did we become too attached 
		to some birds there and name them after <br/> self-checkouts like Food Lion crazed 
		fools, but were described very accurately as "lovebirds" ourselves. <br/>
		<br/>
			<img src="mipueblo.jpg" alt="Mi Pueblo" width="150" height="210"
						border: 2px solid #000000/> <br/>
		Mi Pueblo, the site of our first kiss and many ACP dinners. <br/>
		<br/>
			<img src="promunofficial.jpg" alt="Prom Unofficial" width="240" height="180"
						border: 2px solid #000000/> 
			<img src="prom2.jpg" alt="PROM2" width="125" height="180"
			border: 2px solid #000000/>
			<img src="umbrella.jpg" alt="Umbrella" width="134" height="180"
			border: 2px solid #000000/>
		<br/>
		PROM!!! Easily one of the best nights of my life. I love dancing with you like 
		no one else is watching, especially <br/> when we have no idea what song is playing 
		(which was 95% of the time). So many songs remind me of prom, <br/> such as Mayor of 
		Simpleton, Dancing Queen, the Cotton Eye Joe, Shake it Off, and many more. <br/>
		<br/>
			<img src="dorm.jpg" alt="Dorm" width="180" height="210"
						border: 2px solid #000000/> 
			<img src="melibrary.jpg" alt="Me Library" width="121" height="210"
						border: 2px solid #000000/>
			<img src="gagelibrary.jpg" alt="Gage Library" width="124" height="210"
						border: 2px solid #000000/>
			<img src="parkingdeck.jpg" alt="Parking Deck" width="250" height="210"
						border: 2px solid #000000/>
		<br/>
		My dorm, or as I said when you were here, "my own house". It was fun to show you 
		all of the places that reminded me of you on campus. 
<br/>
		<br/>
		
		Other honorable mentions (which I don't have a picture for) include the literal courthouse to pay my ticket, Lake Norman State Park, 
		<br/>the mall, Pla Mor Lanes for bowling (among other things...), and lots and lots of places to eat. 
	</p>

	<br/>
	If it weren't quite evident already, we are both crazy about eachother. <br/>
	But here is some photographic evidence anyway... <br/>
		<br/>
		<img src="imcooked.jpg" alt="Regina Cooked" width="240" height="179"
					border: 2px solid #000000/>
		<img src="gagecooked.jpg" alt="Gage Cooked" width="240" height="179"
					border: 2px solid #000000/> <br/>
		<img src="imcooked2.jpg" alt="I'm Cooked... Again" width="240" height="179"
		border: 2px solid #000000/>
		<br/>
	As you (and any anyone with eyes) can see, we are quite "cooked", as the youth say. <br/>
	</p>

	<p>
	<br/>
	I also can never seem to be able to stop yapping when we are taking pictures. <br/>
	You are just too interesting to talk too, it seems. <br/>
	<br/>
		<img src="promyap.jpg" alt="Prom Yap" width="165" height="300"
					border: 2px solid #000000/>
		<img src="mipuebloyap.jpg" alt="MiPueblo Yap" width="217" height="300"
					border: 2px solid #000000/> <br/>
	</p>

	<p>
	 <br/>
	The bottom line is this: I love you. You make me so happy, happier than I ever thought
		I could be. <br/> We are so similar, but always are learning from eachother and helping 
		eachother improve. I can't wait for the many, <br/> many, many more months (and years...)
		that we will spend together. <br/>
	<br/>
		Yours always, <br/>
		Regina. <br/>
